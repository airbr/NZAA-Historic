# NZAA PROJECT GOALS

### Current URL:

www.atlantanz.org

NB Several pages/info images and some quality content to re-cycle


## Me

1. Static pages with information about the association, contact info
2. A changing calendar /API for events
3. Ability to accept payments (Paypal/ Square(?) ) for association events
4. That the website be responsive to work well with mobile devices
5. Very easy to be administered by others/handed over from board member to board member.

## Mike

1. Event calendar with links to photos (possibly upload pics from members?)
2. General NZ and association info (maybe some kind of dynamic news feed)
3. Membership listing (secured area? update-able by members?)
4. Mobile app?  I like it! Wouldn't need much in the way of functionality - but if we can do a mobile app - then why not?
5. Paypal is pretty easy to drop in but we might think of a more clever or consistent way of presenting it
6. Historical events - how to make them easily accessible?  Searchable?

## Ian

1. One thing Ive always wanted is a chat room or noticeboard – for members to post small casual social events, meet ups, etc – or to discuss other issues with fellow kiwis living in the US.

2. Page with consular info, and links to official NZ Govt websites with immigration/visa info etc
